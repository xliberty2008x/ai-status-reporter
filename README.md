## 🎯 Project Overview

I designed and built an **enterprise-grade automated project status tracking system** that revolutionized how our team monitors project lifecycles. This solution eliminated manual status reporting, saving **15+ hours weekly** while providing real-time insights through AI-powered natural language queries.

> 🤖 **This repository showcases my expertise in building AI-driven automation solutions, API integrations, and production-ready workflows**

## 💡 Problem Solved

**Challenge:** Our team was manually tracking 100+ game projects across multiple platforms, with status changes happening constantly. This led to:
- Delayed visibility into project bottlenecks
- Missed status updates
- Time-consuming manual reporting
- Difficulty answering stakeholder questions about project history

**My Solution:** A fully automated system that:
- Monitors status changes in real-time
- Generates intelligent weekly/monthly reports
- Provides instant answers through natural language queries
- Maintains a clean, queryable audit trail

## 🏆 Key Achievements
