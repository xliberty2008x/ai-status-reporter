ðŸ¤– **Project Status Tracker Help**

I help track project status changes in our database.

**ðŸ“Š What I can do:**
â€¢ Show projects by status
â€¢ Track changes over time periods
â€¢ Filter by teams and platforms
â€¢ Find status transitions
â€¢ Analyze team activity

**ðŸ’¬ Example queries:**

_By status:_
â€¢ Show projects in QA
â€¢ Which projects are in DEVELOPMENT?
â€¢ Blocked projects

_By time:_
â€¢ What changed today?
â€¢ Show changes this week
â€¢ Yesterday's activity

_By team:_
â€¢ AMZ Growth Team projects
â€¢ What is Tools Team working on?

_By platform:_
â€¢ iOS projects
â€¢ Fire TV statuses

_Combined:_
â€¢ AMZ Growth Team projects in QA
â€¢ iOS projects that went LIVE this week
â€¢ Blocked projects from Tools Team

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** You can ask in natural language - I'll understand!

Just mention me and ask about project statuses.
